To get started, users must register by entering their e-mail address and desired password. 
Once this first step has been completed, they can log in to the application to access their account. 
They can also personalize their profile, add their own files and check out files shared by other users. 
Users can also download multiple files from their dashboard and create shareable links to collaborate with others. 
Furthermore, files can be commented on or appreciated, adding a social dimension to the platform by creating more interaction between multiple users.

Technically, the project was developed using modern technologies such as Figma for design, React for Front-end, Tailwind CSS for styling, 
and Express.js and GraphQL for server management. Finally, we used PostgreSQL as the database management system. 
The mobile application was created using React Native, ensuring a consistent user experience across various platforms. 
The integration of these elements results in an innovative and interactive solution, meeting the diverse needs of our user base.
